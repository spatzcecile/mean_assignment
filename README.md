# mean_assignment

You are to create a python website, using flask, that calculates the mean of GET requests containing a list of numbers. The website should be dockerized, and built using docker compose. 

Then you will create a testing file, using the python library unittest, and these tests should cover: 
- The site working: a test that calls the website's url and confirms a code reply of 200. 
- The site output is correct: a test that sends a GET request to the website and confirms that the website returns the correct answer. 
- The site can handle stress: the average response time of the site should be below 100 ms per request, when 1000 requests are sent per second.
